Welcome to my Turkey Farm  repository! 

This a management system is tailored to be used in the management of turkeys in a farm, its adopted from the poultry management system. The system is built using PHP and SQL for the database and HTML, Javascript and CSS for the user interface-whch are the web forms. I built this system for my final year project for my Diploma in ICT in 2023. The project features various forms that can be used to enter details about the turkeys at different stages of their lives.
